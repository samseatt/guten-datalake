In PostgreSQL, you cannot directly specify the position of a new column when adding it with an `ALTER TABLE` statement. Columns are always added at the end of the table. However, you can achieve the desired column order by creating a new table with the correct schema, migrating the data, and then renaming the tables. 

If the order is not strictly required, the simpler approach is to just add the column at the end:

### Add `variant` Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE subject_study_variants
ADD COLUMN variant TEXT;
```

If the column order is essential:

### Steps to Reorder Columns

1. **Create a Temporary Table with Correct Column Order**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE subject_study_variants_new (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       study_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES subject_studies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
       variant TEXT,
       genotype TEXT,
       effect_size NUMERIC,
       variant_frequency NUMERIC
   );
   ```

2. **Migrate Data to the New Table**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO subject_study_variants_new (id, study_id, genotype, effect_size, variant_frequency)
   SELECT id, study_id, genotype, effect_size, variant_frequency
   FROM subject_study_variants;
   ```

3. **Drop the Original Table**
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE subject_study_variants;
   ```

4. **Rename the New Table**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE subject_study_variants_new
   RENAME TO subject_study_variants;
   ```

This process will add the `variant` column in the desired position while preserving your data and relationships.
